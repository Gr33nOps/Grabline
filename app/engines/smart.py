"""The Smart Engine (F0.3): yt-dlp in-process, behind the resolver.

Three responsibilities:
- ``SmartEngine.matches``: does one of yt-dlp's site extractors recognize this
  URL? (Offline check; the catch-all generic extractor doesn't count.)
- ``SmartEngine.inspect``: extract metadata without downloading and curate the
  format zoo into the short quality list the panel shows (Best/2160p/.../MP3).
- ``SmartDownload``: run one job through yt-dlp with progress mapped onto the
  queue, honoring pause/cancel, with MP3/M4A extraction (+ cover art & tags),
  subtitles, clip trimming (F0.7), and the opt-in browser session (F0.8).

yt-dlp is imported lazily so the CLI stays fast for plain direct downloads.
